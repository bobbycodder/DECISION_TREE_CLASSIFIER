# Decision Tree classifier
__I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy. I implement Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn.__

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Vizualization and  Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# **1. Introduction to Decision Tree algorithm** <a class="anchor" id="1"></a>


__A Decision Tree algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It uses a tree like structure and their possible combinations to solve a particular problem. It belongs to the class of supervised learning algorithms where it can be used for both classification and regression purposes.__


__A decision tree is a structure that includes a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test, and each leaf node holds a class label. The topmost node in the tree is the root node.__


__We make some assumptions while implementing the Decision-Tree algorithm. These are listed below:-__

1. At the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the root.
2. Feature values need to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.
3. Records are distributed recursively on the basis of attribute values.
4. Order to placing attributes as root or internal node of the tree is done by using some statistical approach.
